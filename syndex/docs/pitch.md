# SYNDEX Pitch

## The Problem

Syndicated loan origination is broken.

Every year, **$5+ trillion** in syndicated loans are originated globally. Yet the process of matching deals with the right banking partners remains:

- **Manual & Time-Consuming**: Relationship managers spend weeks calling banks, sending emails, and tracking responses in spreadsheets
- **Relationship-Dependent**: Deals go to "the usual suspects" rather than the best-fit lenders
- **Opaque**: No visibility into which banks are actually interested in specific deal types
- **Inefficient**: 40-60% of invited banks decline, wasting everyone's time

## The Solution: SYNDEX

SYNDEX is an **AI-powered platform** that intelligently matches syndicated loan deals with the optimal banking partners.

### How It Works

1. **Input Your Deal**: Enter borrower details, sector, amount, geography, and terms
2. **AI Analysis**: Our Qwen-powered algorithm analyzes 50+ factors against historical participation data
3. **Smart Matching**: Receive ranked recommendations of banks most likely to participate
4. **Track & Close**: Manage invitations, commitments, and syndication progress in one place
